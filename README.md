A collection of Javascript based examples and experiments

- Javascript Floor Ad: An experiment at creating a rich media style advertisement that sits at the bottom of the browser and packaging it up to be flexible. Simple add in the floor.js file, create a new floor object and pass it any configurations in JSON (It will revert to default if no configs are passed) and call the render() method on it. You can render an expanding or a static floor advertisement.
